# AI Practical Assignments - Group C

This repository is dedicated to the assignments completed as part of the Artificial Intelligence lectures at college. This is strictly an educational project aimed at learning and practicing AI concepts. It is not intended for hobby projects or commercial use.

## Documentation
The documentation for this project will be created using [WriteSide](https://writeside.com), a powerful tool that converts semi-Markdown content into an elegant, professional website with excellent support for technical documentation.

## Backend
The backend for all projects will be implemented using **Python**. We will utilize the **FastAPI** framework, one of the most efficient and modern solutions for building APIs. The backend will primarily handle sending data (e.g., an IP address) through FastAPI endpoints.

## Frontend
The frontend will predominantly be built using the **React Framework**, which provides a robust and flexible foundation for web-based applications. However, depending on the nature of the assignment, we may explore other non-web frontend technologies such as:
- **Pygame**: For desktop-based graphical applications.
- Mobile Applications: If feasible, we may experiment with mobile development frameworks.

## Disclaimer
For projects that are not web-based, a **video demonstration** will be provided instead of hosting the application on GitHub or any other platform. This ensures that the functionality can still be showcased effectively.
